Evolved QUantum Adversarial Neural Incrypted Messages In The Year 3000
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a small project building on the [Google Brain Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06918v1.pdf) to teach AIs to design cryptosystems.
Notable differences include the removal of a large pre-shared key, instead focusing on public-key cryptosystems, and the extension to post quantum computing.
Right now the code is in a mostly non-functional state, although several functional components are present.
